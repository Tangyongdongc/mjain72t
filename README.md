# Transfer-learning-multi-model-(CNN-XGBoost-SVC)
Plant seedlings classification using three classifiers: XGBoost, SVC abd CNN  in combination with transfer learning and OpenCV. We used weights from pre trained VGG19 model to take tha advantage of transfer learning to train a classification model to determine different specied of seelings. The image data can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification/data .The ensemble model from these classifiers was created.
